# SIXMFIVE
A nearby resturaunt viewing app made in SwiftUI that takes in data from the Yelp Api and uses Core Location to get nearby resturaunts. The project uses cards to display various information nearby. The current project is still in the early development stage. If you encounter any problems during the test, please contact me.
